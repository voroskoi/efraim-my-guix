    (description
     "VCR.py simplifies and speeds up tests that make HTTP requests.  The first
time you run code that is inside a VCR.py context manager or decorated function,
VCR.py records all HTTP interactions that take place through the libraries it
supports and serializes and writes them to a flat file (in yaml format by
default).  This flat file is called a cassette.  When the relevant piece of code
is executed again, VCR.py will read the serialized requests and responses from
the aforementioned cassette file, and intercept any HTTP requests that it
recognizes from the original test run and return the responses that corresponded
to those requests.  This means that the requests will not actually result in
HTTP traffic, which confers several benefits including:
@enumerate
@item The ability to work offline
@item Completely deterministic tests
@item Increased test execution speed
@end enumerate
If the server you are testing against ever changes its API, all you need to do
is delete your existing cassette files, and run your tests again.  VCR.py will
detect the absence of a cassette file and once again record all HTTP
interactions, which will update them to correspond to the new API.")
